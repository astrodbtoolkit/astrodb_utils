Notes
-----
Relationships are constrained but should be one of the following:
- *Child*: The source is lower mass/fainter than the companion
- *Sibling*: The source is similar to the companion
- *Parent*: The source is higher mass/brighter than the companion
- *Unresolved Parent*: The source is the unresolved, combined light source of an unresolved multiple system which includes the companion
